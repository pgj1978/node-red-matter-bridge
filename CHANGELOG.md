## [0.11.2] - 2024-12-06
Fixes I should have spotted if I'd done 0.11.1 properly!

### Fixed
willUpdate not imported on some devices
missed the passthrough on doorLock
spotted a bug with step-change on level control when using 0-100 scale 

## [0.11.1] - 2024-12-05
Fixes for functionality introduced in 0.11

### Added
Added api for re-opening commisioning from Node-RED, but not yet exposed in UI
### Changed
The passthrough logic has been improved and implemented on all nodes.


### Fixed
Bug with dimmable/color lights using the 0-100 scale that was causing an infinite loop & crash

Fixed the issue where devices were being removed and readded from ecosystems when nodes were restarted causing a loss of room assignments and automations


## [0.11.0] - 2024-12-01
Lots of improvements to core functionality and stablity

### Added
Disabled nodes & flows are now ignored and the bridge will cleanly start without them.

Can now choose Mired or Kelvin as the unit for light color temperatures.

Dimmable lights now have an increase/decrease level command with a configurable step level in the node.

### Changed
The behaviour of passthorugh has been changed on the on/off light, on/off socket & dimmable light to make it more consistent. As per issue https://github.com/sammachin/node-red-matter-bridge/issues/6
Other nodes have not yet had this change implemeted as it needs some field testing to see if its the right approach then I can tackle the more complex ones.

Interfaces that are internal (eg localhost) or only support IPv4 are removed from the interface selection, hopefully to avoid user confusion.

Major refactor to the event emmitters and close event to allow for deploying only modified nodes and not needing a full bridge restart.

Logging output has been improved to use Node-RED standard.

Server will only be started if it is not running avoiding a risk of dual servers

try/catch implemented on server start and endpoint add functions to reduce risk of a single config change crashing node-red.
